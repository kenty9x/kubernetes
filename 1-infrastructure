# 1 - Infrastructure Lab

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a baseline environment that we'll use for out kubernetes installation.  
I have tried this on Windows-10 Pro.

## Virtual Box

- install (or upgrade) [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- I am using 6.1.32 for this installation.
- The extension pack is not needed for the lab.
- The setup program will issue a warning about an interface to be installed.  
This is OK.
- Add the following directory into your path:
    C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
  so that you can run VirtualBox cli commands.

## K8S Virtual Machine Template

- Download Fedora 35 (server, VirtualBox, vdi file) from osboxes.org.  
    link: https://www.osboxes.org/fedora/  
    user: **root**    pass: **osboxes.org**
- Unzip (I use [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)) the downloaded file - this is a virtual disk image (VDI) file.
- VirtualBox: Create a Linux (RedHat 64G) machine (as a template)
- 8192 MB of RAM - 1 virtual cpu (2 for the control node later)
- Use your downloaded VDI file as the system disk.


## Host Machine

- Create another machine to be used as a host - to connect and configure.
- I'm using a local Linux (Ubuntu-20) as a host, to control the cluster.
- You can use other distributions here (Fedore Workstations for example, or even another server, so non-GUI and work with a tool like [tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/)).  
A GUI based one is easier to work with.
